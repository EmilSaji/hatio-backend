# Project Setup

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- For the database, I am using MySQL, and it's hosted on a database-as-a-service platform called Aiven. You don't have to set up the database locally; just ensure that you are connected to an internet connection.


### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:EmilSaji/hatio-backend.git

2. Go to the Project Folder: 
    ```sh 
    cd hatio-backend

3. Install dependencies
    ```sh
    npm install

4. Run the server
    ```sh
    node server.js

### Stack Used

``` Backend: Express JS, MySQL ```

### Instructions

Start the server first. If there are no errors, you'll see a log message in console showing the connected port and the database connection status. After that, start the frontend of the app.
